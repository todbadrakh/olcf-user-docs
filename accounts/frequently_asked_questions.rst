Frequently Asked Questions

How do I apply for an account?
=================================

Detailed instructions for account application can be found in the
:ref:`applying-for-a-user-account`
section of the :ref:`accounts-and-projects` page.

What is the status of my application?
=======================================

Detailed instructions for checking the status of your account application
can be found in the :ref:`checking-application-status` section of the
:ref:`accounts-and-projects` page.

How should I acknowledge the OLCF in my publications and presentations?
==========================================================================

Users should acknowledge the OLCF in all publications and presentations
that speak to work performed on OLCF resources:

    This research used resources of the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing
    Facility at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which is supported by the
    Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract No.
    DE-AC05-00OR22725.


What is a subproject?
==========================

Many OLCF projects make use of optional subprojects. Subprojects provide
a useful means for

-  dividing allocations among different applications, groups, or
   individuals
-  controlling priority
-  monitoring progress

Similar to individual user accounts being granted resources by their
association with a project, individual user accounts are granted the
resources of a subproject upon association with the subproject.

.. note::
    Subprojects do not inherit the accesses of their primary
    projects, and users can be associated with a subproject without
    association with the primary project.

The ID for a subproject must follow the format of: **<6 character
primary project ID>** + **<1-4 character subproject suffix>**. For
example, project ABC123 could have subprojects ABC123XYZ6 and ABC123P3.
The hours allocated for the primary project and subprojects must equal
the awarded allocation. All hours can be allocated to subprojects, or
some amount can be held as reserve as part of the primary project. It is
recommended that all users be assigned to a subproject(s). If all of a
primary project's awarded hours are allocated to its subprojects, all
primary project users must be associated with a subproject(s). If you
have any questions, or would like to request a subproject, please
contact the OLCF Accounts Team at accounts@ccs.ornl.gov.

.. note::
    Subprojects are created at the request of project PIs.


I no longer need my account. Who should I inform and what should I do with my OLCF issued RSA SecurID token?
=============================================================================================================

Please inform the Accounts Team via email at accounts@ccs.ornl.gov and
return the RSA SecurID Token to the following address depending on the
mail service:

For US Mail:

::

	Accounts Team
	Oak Ridge National Laboratory
	PO Box 2008, MS 6014
	Oak Ridge, TN 37830-6014

For FedEx/UPS:

::

	Accounts Team
	Oak Ridge National Laboratory
	1 Bethel Valley Road, MS 6014
	Oak Ridge, TN 37831-6014

My SecurID token is broken/expired. What should I do?
=======================================================

If your project is still active and you require continued access to
OLCF, you'll need to request a replacement fob. To do so, contact either
the User Assistance Team (help@olcf.ornl.gov) or the Accounts Team
(`accounts@olcf.ornl.gov <mailto:accounts@ccs.ornl.gov>`__). You do not
need to return the broken/expired RSA token to OLCF. Disposal and
recycling information can be found in the vendor's `disposal
statement <https://community.rsa.com/t5/support-information/rsa-statement-on-safe-use-and-disposal-of-rsa-securid-tokens/ta-p/569883>`__.

Getting Help
==============

When submitting a ticket to help@olcf.ornl.gov requesting help, you will likely
get faster resolution by supporting a few best practices:

- Where possible, provide helpful details that can help speed the process. For
  example: Project ID, relevant directories, job scripts, jobIDs, modules at
  compile/runtime, host name, etc.
- When replying to a ticket, do not modify the subject line.
- Do not piggyback unrelated questions on existing tickets. This leads to slower
  response times and inflates ticket history.
- Do not open multiple tickets on the same unresolved topic. Doing so can
  fragment resources and slow down the time to resolution.
- Please do not respond to previous tickets with new, unrelated issues. This can
  slow down response time and make finding relevant information harder thereby
  slowing down time to resolution.
- Let us know if you've solved the issue yourself (and let us know what worked!)
- MOST IMPORTANT: do not hesitate to contact us (help@olcf.ornl.gov); we will
  work through the details with you.
