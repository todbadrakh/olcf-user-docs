Authentication and Account Setup
********************************

OLCF Moderate and Open users, as well as ORNL staff and students, can create a Constellation account to reserve DOIs and publish data. Visit `https://doi.ccs.ornl.gov <https://doi.ccs.ornl.gov>`_ and authenticate using an OLCF username and passcode (PIN + RSA SecurID TOKENCODE) or ORNL UCAMS/XCAMS three-character username and passphrase. The first time a user logs in they will be asked to enter a Globus user identity, and to accept a User Agreement describing Constellationâ€™s terms of use.

To use an existing Globus identity, go to `https://www.globus.org/get-started <https://www.globus.org/get-started>`_ and click 'Log In.' Most non-profit organizations including DOE national labs offer log in using institutional credentials. After logging in, your Globus identity can be found under Settings > Account > Identity. Your primary identity may be in the form of an email address or a 36-character UUID. Either value may be used with Constellation.

If institutional log in is not available for Globus, obtain a personal Globus ID. Navigate to `https://globusid.org/create <https://globusid.org/create>`_ and complete the registration form. You will be asked to verify your email address. Once you confirm your email address, you can find your Globus ID by going to Settings > Account > Identity. Your primary identity is the first field displayed next to a crown icon and may be in the form of an email address or [globus_username]@globusid.org.

After logging in to Constellation, you will be taken to your account dashboard.
