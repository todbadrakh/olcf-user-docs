Infrastructure
**************

Constellation leverages OLCF infrastructure for secure management of large datasets. Globus is used for data access and transfer. Draft datasets are uploaded to the Orion parallel filesystem in the Moderate security enclave via the OLCF DOI-UPLOADS Globus collection. After review and approval for publication, data are migrated to Themis, an IBM Spectrum Archive storage system in the Open security enclave. Data on Themis is open to the public, but users must register for a Globus account to download files.

To the extent reasonable, Constellation will endeavor to provide access to deposited data for a minimum period of 10 years. Constellation will attempt to maintain data and supporting files in the forms they were originally submitted. In some cases, Constellation may maintain the content, structure and/or functionality of the files through format migration or other appropriate strategies. Constellation will also strive to provide basic services which may include backup, obsolescence management, and periodic refreshment by copying the data to new storage media.
