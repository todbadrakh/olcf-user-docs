Constellation Overview
**********************

OLCF provides `Constellation <https://doi.ccs.ornl.gov>`_, a data repository and DOI service for open scientific research data. Constellation enables users to share, browse, search, and download datasets associated with research projects conducted within or in collaboration with OLCF and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). Constellation helps researchers comply with DOE public sharing requirements including the DOE Public Access Plan and DOE O 241.1C. Data submissions may be from any scientific domain and are carefully reviewed before being made available to the general public.

Constellation is suitable for datasets of all sizes, ranging from a couple of megabytes up to petabyte-scale publications. Archival storage and access are provided for a period of up to ten years before a review is conducted for continued retention and preservation.

Each dataset published via Constellation is assigned a Digital Object Identifier (DOI). A DOI is a unique and persistent alphanumeric identifier used to identify and resolve digital "objects" such as articles, reports, and datasets. Constellation obtains and activates DataCite DOIs through membership in the DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information's (OSTI) Data ID Service.

For scientific researchers, obtaining DOIs for their datasets is crucial as this facilitates proper citation and enhances the discoverability of their work in the scientific community. By providing a stable link to the data, a DOI allows other researchers to easily find, cite, and build upon the published datasets, promoting transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration. DOIs can also help researchers track the impact and usage of their data over time, increasing the visibility and credibility of their research contributions.
